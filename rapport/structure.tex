\section{Goal of our project}

Our project, proposed by our tutor D. Le Botlan is titled ``Adptive Flight''.
It is composed of two main parts.\\

The first one is about target detection and autonomous flight.\\
The other one is obstacle avoidance.\\

Actually, our UAV must be able to detect a target, flight to this point and above all, avoid the human obstacles.\\

\section{Documentation \& deliverables}

In the beginning of the project we have created a website on our project. It can be accessed at :\\

~~\\

We have also written technical documentation : PMP, SRS and STD. They can be downloaded in the ``Sources'' section of our website.\\

Regarding software production, we have used the versionning manager git. Our code is hosted at this url :\\
